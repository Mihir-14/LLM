            Archimedes was a Greek mathematician and scientist. He was born in Syracuse, Sicily in the year 287 B.C. He was educated
            in Alexandria, Egypt. Due to the lack of information about Greek mathematics, many Greek mathematicians and their works
            are hardly known. Archimedes is the exception. Archimedes was very preoccupied with mathematics. For instance, he often
            forgot to eat and bathe because of his always wanted to solve problems.
