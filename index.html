            Archimedes
        </h1>
        <div style="margin-top: 10px;">
            Archimedes was a Greek mathematician and scientist. He was born in Syracuse, Sicily in the year 287 B.C. He was educated
            in Alexandria, Egypt. Due to the lack of information about Greek mathematics, many Greek mathematicians and their works
            are hardly known. Archimedes is the exception. Archimedes was very preoccupied with mathematics. For instance, he often
            forgot to eat and bathe because of his always wanted to solve problems.
            <br>
            The most famous story of Archimedes life involves the discovery of Archimedes' Principle. The story begins when King
            Hieron asking a goldsmith to construct a gold wreath to the immortal gods. After some time, the king came to suspect
            that the wreath was not pure gold but rather filled with silver. In order to end his suspicion, the king asked
            Archimedes to determine whether the wreath was pure gold or filled with gold without destroying it. Archimedes agreed to
            try to solve the king's problem.
